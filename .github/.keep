[4 Points] Create a new pull request containing at minimum the following:
          Intended platform for final project (e.g. Android, iOS): Android.
          Intended framework/programming language for your final project: Java or Python
          Whether you want to explore cross-platform development: Potentially.
          Include a brief explanation for your selections: I chose android because I prefer the OS over iOS. I'm likely very biased because I've only ever used
                                                           Android phones. My choices in the programming language is still iffy and it's because I would like to
                                                           try crossplatform development but I'm not sure if there is a requirement of what language needs to be used.
                                                           If possible I would like to only use one language if to only save time. I want to try cross-platform
                                                           development because I personally just enjoy being able to interact with people on apps that are cross platform
